# Brawldew-Valley

This is a fun project to learn unity and experience with building a game.
The idea is to create a 2 players brawler in 2D. 
Players will compete in a fast paced combat as they are thrown into an arena filled with pickups, buffs and traps!
They will attempt to gain power ups and abilities to reach godlike power and defeat their opponent.
First one to reach 10 kill points wins!
